		<meta name="description" content="Eugene Verbitsku contributed to the wProperty project as a Unity developer, focusing on the integration of interactive components within the application. His work involved developing several basic features using Unity to support the visual and user-interactive aspects of the real estate app.  While Eugene completed his assigned tasks and demonstrated a working knowledge of Unity, his overall involvement in the project was limited. The level of enthusiasm and initiative expected in a collaborative and fast-paced development environment was not always present. As a result, his contribution, while functional, remained within a narrow scope and did not significantly influence the broader progress or innovation of the application.  There is potential for Eugene to further grow as a developer by strengthening his engagement with the development process, seeking feedback actively, and taking a more proactive role in team collaboration. With greater involvement and commitment, he could expand both his technical competencies and his contribution to future projects.
